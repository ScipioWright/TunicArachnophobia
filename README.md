- Extract the zip folder you downloaded from the previous step into your game's install directory (For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TUNIC)
  - For the PC Game Pass version, extract the zip into the "Content" folder, i.e. C:\XboxGames\Tunic\Content
- Launch the game and close it. This will finalize the BepInEx installation.
- Download the latest release and copy it into BepInEx/plugins under your game's install directory.
- To uninstall the mod, either remove/delete the TunicRandomizer.dll file from the plugins folder or rename the winhttp.dll file located in the game's root directory (this will disable all installed mods from running).
